***Overview***

Suicide is a global public health issue, with millions of lives lost each year. One of the biggest challenges in suicide prevention is identifying individuals who may be at risk before it's too late. Traditional methods of mental health assessment often rely on subjective evaluations and self-reporting, making it difficult to intervene effectively.
Leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) presents an opportunity to develop proactive solutions for suicide detection and mental health monitoring. In this hackathon, participants will tackle the challenge of developing an AI-driven solution for suicide detection and mental health monitoring. The objective is to create a system that can analyze various data sources to identify individuals who may be at risk of suicide or experiencing deteriorating mental health, thereby enabling timely intervention and support.
